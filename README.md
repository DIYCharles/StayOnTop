# StayOnTop
This program lets you set windows to persist on top even when working on active windows behind it. 


# How To Make The Page Persist On Top

1. Download StayOnTop.exe from this repo 
2. Run the .exe
3. Open the webcam stream popup window and click on the top taskbar for the window to make sure it is the selected active window 
4. Type Ctrl+Spacebar

The page should now persist on top and allow you to use the window actively underneath

To stop always on top either exit the oage or go to your tray in the taskbar and right click on the atom icon StayOnTop and select pause script.
