</br>

##### StayOnTop lets you set windows to persist on top even when working on active windows behind it. You can set any program window in Windows to do this as well as many windows you'd like. 
Here is an example of keeping a website on top to reference as ypu code behind it.

Great for multi tasking and watching media while working in another program!
